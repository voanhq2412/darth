    "The Hessian contains useful information about the curvature of the optimization landscape. However, second-order methods (such as Newton's method) that incoporates curvature information are not as popular as first-order methods in Deep Learning due to the fact that computation of the whole Hessian is intractable and that it may not always point in a descent direction. Even for convex problems, Quasi-Newton's methods are preferred over pure Newton's methods, much less high-dimensional non-convex problems.\n",

All these papers have shown increased generalization performance by incoporating curvature information. \n",
